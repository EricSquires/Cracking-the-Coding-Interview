# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview
I've decided to run through Cracking the Coding Interview to prime myself for my current job search. I'll be
posting solutions to the problems within the book to this repository.

After a slow start, I've decided to eliminate the performance testing of multiple solutions that I was
initially doing. I'll be focusing on rapid development and unit testing of solutions in order to try
to get through everything in a more timely fashion.
