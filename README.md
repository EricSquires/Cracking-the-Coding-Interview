# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview
I've decided to run through Cracking the Coding Interview to prime myself for my nascent/current job search. I'll be posting solutions to the problems within the book to this repository.

My plan is to run through the problems relatively quickly cranking out the first solution that comes to mind for each problem. At the end of each chapter, I'll review my solutions and consider improving, but I want to start by getting a decent amount of code out there before I worry about optimization.

Progress:

1. Arrays and Strings
  1. **Is Unique**:  Naive solution
  2. **Check Permutation**: Naive solution
  3. **URLify**:
  4. **Palindrome Permutation**:
  5. **One Away**:
  6. **String Compression**:
  7. **Rotate Matrix**:
  8. **Zero Matrix**:
  9. **String Rotation**:
