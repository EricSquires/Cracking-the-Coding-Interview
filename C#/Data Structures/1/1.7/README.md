#Rotate Matrix

Here we need to take a square matrix and rotate it 90Â°. The book doesn't specify clockwise or counter-clockwise so any solution I devise will implement both.

###Rotator

Another simple algorithm, all we need to do in the simple case (not in place) is iterate through each row/column and copy things over to the output matrix.
